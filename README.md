# AframeVR

This is an A-Frame VR exercise for LMC 4733 (Mixed-Reality Design). I created an animated VR version of the Bauhaus Stripe Art using A-Frame. I decided to animate the vertical bars to go behind and in front of the circle to add the visual element of depth and change. I don't have as much experience animating in A-Frame, so I wanted to practice some movement with this Bauhaus-esque artwork. At first, I tried rotating the bars on the z-axis, but it didn't feel quite right; to better match the original art, I decided to animate the positioning of the bars on the z-axis, moving them forward and backwards, in front of and behind the circle.
